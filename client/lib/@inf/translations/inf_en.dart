#### 1. Anonymous Data Storage
**1.1 Data Anonymity:** We understand the importance of protecting your personal information. Our Application stores all user data in a fully anonymous way. This means that your personal data is dissociated from any identifiable information, such as your name, email address, or physical address.

**1.2 User Data:** When you use our Application, we may collect and store certain data, including financial transaction details, budget information, and other financial data. This data is stripped of any personal identifiers and stored in a manner that prevents it from being linked back to you as an individual.

#### 2. Protection of Personal Textual Information
**2.1 Master Password:** We take the security of your personal textual information seriously. No one, including our team or any third parties, will have access to any user's personal textual information without the master password provided by the user. This master password is used to encrypt and decrypt your sensitive data.

**2.2 Encryption:** Your personal textual information is stored using strong encryption methods to ensure that it remains confidential and secure. Even if we were to gain access to the encrypted data, we would not be able to decipher it without your master password.

#### 3. Reliable and Trusted Integration Providers
**3.1 Integration Providers:** We may integrate with various third-party services and providers to enhance the functionality of our Application. These integrations are carefully selected to ensure the highest level of reliability and trustworthiness.

**3.2 Data Sharing:** When integrating with third-party providers, we only share data that is necessary to provide you with the intended services or features. We do not share any personally identifiable information without your explicit consent.

**3.3 Privacy Policies:** We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party integration providers we use, as they may have their own data collection and usage practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.
